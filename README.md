# Industry App Classifying & Grading

**IACG** is an experimental B/S system for industry app classifying and grading.

- This is the source codes of my programming assignment of SE2019 courses.

## Development

Use Visual Studio Community 2019 (v16.3.10) with "ASP.NET and Web Development" workload.

Open `IACG.sln` in VS and press `F5`. It takes time to restore libraries and front-end packages.

Then visit `https://localhost:5001/` or `http://localhost:5000` to view the website.
